# Scrolling Text Animation using HTML, CSS & GSAP

## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates **smooth scrolling text animations** created using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)**. The animation triggers as the user scrolls, creating engaging text effects commonly used in modern websites, landing pages, and portfolios.

GSAP provides high‑performance animations, while CSS handles layout and styling, and HTML structures the content.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. Text elements are styled using CSS for positioning and appearance.
2. GSAP animates text properties such as:

   * `x / y` movement
   * `opacity`
   * `scale`
3. **ScrollTrigger** connects animations to the scroll position, allowing text to animate when entering or leaving the viewport.
